	title = {Treatment of personality pathology through the lens of the hierarchical taxonomy of psychopathology: {Developing} a research agenda},
	abstract = {Despite the emphasis on evidence-based treatment for psychological disorders, to date, there has been limited research examining treatment for nine of the 10 categorical personality disorders in DSM-5 Section 2. This is perhaps not surprising given the complex heterogeneity and co-morbidity within personality pathology. The hierarchical taxonomy of psychopathology (HiTOP) was proposed to address limitations within the traditional categorical model of the diagnostic system. Within this system are ﬁve spectra: detachment, antagonistic externalizing, disinhibited externalizing, thought disorder and internalizing. These foundational personality traits potentially have direct and speciﬁc treatment implications. The purpose of this paper is to highlight potential psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment recommendations within the personality spectra. Additionally, we outline the advantages of considering the personality science found within dimensional models of psychopathology in clinical assessment and intervention to aid in treatment planning. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a major public health concern. Web-based personalized feedback interventions (PFIs) may be a cost-effective and efficient way to treat NSSI. In order to develop a PFI, it is imperative to assess descriptive and injunctive norms. The current study examines descriptive and injunctive norms of NSSI within college students and adults in the community, comparing how perceived norms may differ for those who do or do not engage in NSSI. Study 1 calculated percentages of NSSI behavior within the student sample. Study 2 then examined perceived descriptive and injunctive norms between those with and without history of NSSI in both samples. Study 1 indicated that 19\% of undergraduate students had histories of NSSI. Additionally, there was a general tendency to overestimate the percentage of people who engage in NSSI and the number of times a typical person engages in NSSI. Finally, those who engaged in NSSI believed that most people do not understand why individuals engage in NSSI; comparatively, the majority of people without history of NSSI still indicated that they understand why others would engage in NSSI. These research findings may be utilized in a PFI to reduce shame and NSSI behavior.},

	abstract = {Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of the most studied personality disorders and is associated with significant outcomes such as suicide. Although BPD is represented in DSM-5 as a categorical diagnosis, it may be better characterized dimensionally, such as from the perspective of the five-factor model of general personality (FFM). The Five-Factor Borderline Inventory (FFBI) assesses BPD from the perspective of maladaptive variants of FFM traits. Previous research suggests that informant-reports may increase the validity of personality disorder assessment, providing additional information that may supplement self-report. Therefore, the current study developed an informant measure of the FFBI, Informant Five-Factor Borderline Inventory (IFFBI) and examined its convergent and discriminant validity compared with the self-report FFBI, FFM, and traditional measure of BPD. Overall, the IFFBI demonstrated good convergent validity and moderate discriminant validity with the FFBI, FFM, and other traditional measures of BPD.},
