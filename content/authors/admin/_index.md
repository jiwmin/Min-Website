Jiwon “Jennie” Min is a clinical psychology PhD candidate from Oklahoma State University with adult psychopathology, quantitative method, and health psychology specialization. She is part of the Personality and Psychopathology lab with Dr. Stephanie Mullins-Sweatt. She is currently at University of Mississippi Medical Center completing her one-year APA-accredited clinical psychology internship. From 2021-2022, Jennie also was part of the Businelle Lab at University of Oklahoma Health Science Center with Dr. Michael Businelle. Before joining graduate school, she was part of the Center for Advanced Measurement of Personality and Psychpathology Lab at the University of Notre Dame with Dr. Lee Anna Clark.

Her primary research interest is in multi-method, multi-informant assessment of personality pathology and mobile treatment of related maladaptive behaviors (e.g., nonsuicidal self-injury, smoking, substance use). Specifically, she is interested in using technology to better assess, understand mechanisms of, and treat maladaptive behaviors related to personality pathology. She primarily uses ecological momentary assessment in her research to examine daily mechanisms of personality pathology and maladaptive behaviors. 

Jennie’s dissertation project titled, “The Development of Brief Personalized Mobile Intervention for Nonsuicidal Self-Injury”. The project developed a 2-week personalized mobile intervention by adapting existing emotion regulation-based treatments and conducted an open pilot trial to assess for acceptability, credibility, utility, and feasibility of the intervention. 

She is currently searching for postdoctoral fellowship starting 2023.
