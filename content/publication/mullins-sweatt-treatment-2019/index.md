abstract: 'Despite the emphasis on evidence-based treatment for psychological disorders,
  to date, there has been limited research examining treatment for nine of the 10
  categorical personality disorders in DSM-5 Section 2. This is perhaps not surprising
  given the complex heterogeneity and co-morbidity within personality pathology. The
  hierarchical taxonomy of psychopathology (HiTOP) was proposed to address limitations
  within the traditional categorical model of the diagnostic system. Within this system
  are ﬁve spectra: detachment, antagonistic externalizing, disinhibited externalizing,
  thought disorder and internalizing. These foundational personality traits potentially
  have direct and speciﬁc treatment implications. The purpose of this paper is to
  highlight potential psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment recommendations
  within the personality spectra. Additionally, we outline the advantages of considering
  the personality science found within dimensional models of psychopathology in clinical
  assessment and intervention to aid in treatment planning. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons,
